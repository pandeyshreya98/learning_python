#like in other programming languages python also has its own data types.
#1. numbers   immutable
#2. boolean    immutable 
#3. list      mutable
#4. tuple       immutable
#5. string        immutable
#6. dictionary    mutable
#7. set        mutable


# three things must be kept in mind while studying data types
#1. operators
#2. methods
#3. builtin functions

## except numbers and boolean,other types in python are sequential.
#eg list,set ,dictionary,tuple and string ##

# if an obj can never be altered than it is immutable object
