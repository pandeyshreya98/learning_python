What is version control??
=> there can be different versions of the same project which should be backward compatible (paila ko code ni maintain bhairaxa)
=> these differnt versions of the same project is maintainde by a version control system
=> there are different version control systems like git, mercurial etc. Git is the most famous one 

why to use a version control system?
=> to maintain project versions efficiently and with less manual work.
=>for effective team colaboration 

=> the project maintained with version control system is later uploaded somewhere in the cloud.
=> there are several cloud storage services like google drive, one drive,s3. but these storage systems 
do not cooperate with version control(eg git)
=> so we should use such cloud services which understand version control. there are several such services
for eg github, gitlab , bitbucket
